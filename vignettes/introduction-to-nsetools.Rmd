[NSE](https://www.nseindia.com/) (National Stock Exchange) is the leading stock exchange of India, located in the city of Mumbai. While users can manually download data from NSE through a browser, importing this data into R is then cumbersome. The nsetools R package implements the retrieval of data from NSE and aims to reduce the pre-processing steps needed in analyzing such data.

nsetools is inspired by and a port of the Python package [nsetools](https://nsetools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The authors and contributors for this R package are not affiliated with NSE and NSE does not offer support for this R package.

With nsetools, you can fetch the following data related to:

- stocks
    - quote for a given stock
    - symbol & name
    - check validity
    - most actively traded stocks in a month
    - 52 week high/low
    - top gainers/losers for the last trading session
- index
    - list indices
    - check validity
    - fetch indices quote
- futures & options
    - lot size
    - top gainers/losers for the last trading session
- pre open data
    - nifty
    - nifty bank
    - nifty futures & options
- indices advances & declines


## Usage

nsetools uses consistent prefix `nse_` for easy tab completion.

- `nse_index_` for index 
- `nse_stock_` for stocks
- `nse_fo_` for futures and options
- `nse_preopen_` for preopen data
